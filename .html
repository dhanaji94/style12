        <p>Nature refers to how genetics influence an individual's personality,
             whereas nurture refers to how their environment 
             (including relationships and experiences) impacts their development.
              Whether nature or nurture plays a bigger role in personality and
               development is one of the oldest philosophical debates within the field of psychology.

        <p>People with extreme views are called nativists and empiricists.
             Nativists take the position that all or most behaviors and
              characteristics are the result of inheritance.
               Empiricists take the position that all or most behaviors and characteristics result from learning.

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>Some psychological theories of child development place more emphasis on nature and others focus more on nurture.
             An example of a nativist theory involving child development is Chomsky's concept
              of a language acquisition device (LAD).1 According to this theory, all children are born with an 
            instinctive mental capacity that allows them to both learn and produce language.
